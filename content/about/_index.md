**More than 12 years of experience in IT, Cloud and Cybersecurity** 

I am currently working as a Google Cloud Security Architect at Xebia. In February 2022 I started to work at Xebia. Since the start I've had the honor to work for really cool customers like Mollie and ASML and helping them take their Google Cloud Security to the next level. Besides the projects for customers, I also give talks and trainings about Google Cloud Security. 

**To the Cloud and Beyond!** 

In 2018 I worked as a Cybersecurity consultant at PwC. The Security projects that I worked on were for large banks such as ING and ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. 

Back in 2014 we run our own early version of what would become the Cloud as how we know it today. Our company Deviate was running multiple servers at two datacenters, that had an secure interconnect and a hypervisor layer that could fail-over the Virtual Machines over to the other datacenter. This gave us a high availability setup to keep our Mobile app business running non-stop!

Information Analyst 
Designing and implementing IT solution for large banks, insurance companies and pensionfunds (Clearing and Settlement). 

TIBCO Integration Consultant
My career started after I graduated (2011) as a TIBCO Consultant. I designed and built workflows for customers in TIBCO (AMX) ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks and TIBCO BPM for NN, ING and Van gansewinkel.

**How it all started** \
At the age of 11 years Jorge started to work for the first time with a computer that had an internet connection. It was an old PC running Microsoft Windows 95. This was at my high school. The computers were connected to each other with a COAX ring network, and the internet was a good old ISDN dialup internet connection with a total bandwidth of 128kbits, bundling 2x 64 kbits channels. The internet was shared with more than 10 computers. In the end I got the opportunity to help the school in it's transition to a new network based on ethernet switches, high speed bandwith, workstations running Windows 2000 Pro conntected to a Windows domain controller running the Activity Directory and enforcing Group Policies.

The Apple Macintosh 128K was the first computer that amazed me and sparked my interest for computers. I never had the chance to work on the Apple Macintosh.

The first computer I played on was an Atari 2600 followed by a Commodore 64. I was fortunate enough that my grandfather (who worked for the SWIFT financial network), my brother, and my cousin were all also interested in IT.

I got my first computer at home when I was ten years old. It was a 386 PC, running MS-DOS and with a monitor with green letters.

From my 16th year, I started to help others with computer problems. After a will, I decided to use my computer skills to start my own business to help businesses with their IT.

I helped a lot of businesses. Mostly, medical professionals like doctors and dentists design and build networks and servers. What drives me the most was designing reliable and secure solutions to prevent unnecessary handling for patients; for example, a re-take of an X-RAY exposing a patient to radiation due to a failing IT system. In my opinion, IT should make healthcare better, faster, and safer for patients!
