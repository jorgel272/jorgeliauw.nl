Last week I celebrated working one year at Xebia. Time flies when you're having fun 😀 What better excuse to share some nice cake with other Xebians 🍰

Every day working with my favorite Cloud almost doesn’t feel like work 😉

Thank you all at Xebia Google Cloud Mollie and ASML for making this first year awesome with great collaborations and cool Google Cloud Security projects 🎉 Looking forward to what the future will bring! See you in the Cloud ⛅️
