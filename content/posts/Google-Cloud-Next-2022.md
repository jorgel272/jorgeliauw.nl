On the 11th of November 2022 I was honourd to present onstage at Google Cloud Next 2022 Recap in Antwerpen, Belgium together with our friends from Google Cloud and Travix. 

{{< figure src="/images/GoogleCloudNext-Jorge-Presenting-Security-2022.webp" title="" >}}

During my presentation I talked about why Security is important in the Cloud. 
The security in the cloud and how to mitage or at least lower the risk around
these security risks.

I discussed the following Security challenges from a process and technical perspective:

- Gain Full Observability
- Continuous Compliance
- Scaling Security Capabilities
- Store infra and app passwords securely
- Defining use cases for Security

Feel free to contact me if you want to more about security challenges in the cloud and the solutions to solve them.
