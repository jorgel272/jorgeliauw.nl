**Google Cloud User Group Christmas Edition 2022**

Last week we hosted the last Google Cloud ⛅ User Group meetup of 2022! The event was all about Data 🗂 & Analytics 🔎 .
Big thanks to our guests and presenters for making this a great evening 👏 Vito Minheere and Constantijn Visinescu

The speakers presented about the topics: Small scale Data Mesh and Analysing streaming data.

**Small scale Data Mesh by Vito Minheere**
He will introduce the Data Mesh Concepts, how they can be understood and applied. Entire architecture strategies can be thought out covering thousands of microservices but what does a Data Mesh look like on a small scale? How could it be made more comprehensible? And most importantly, where would you start?

**Analysing streaming data on Google Cloud by Constantijn Visinescu**
Streaming systems are great for monitoring and acting on data in real-time, but at some point you're also going to want to run analysis on all that streaming data. We will show you how to manage it with using the new BigQuery subscription for pubsub. Expect a hands on live demo by Constantijn.

The 2022 Google Cloud User Group sessions were impossible to organise without the help of the awesome Google Fahd Ekadioin, the Xebia heroes Annemieke Stigter Simon Karman and Walter van der Scheer! 

Stay tuned for new Google Cloud meetups in 2023, and enjoy the after-movie! Happy Holidays 🎄 🎅
