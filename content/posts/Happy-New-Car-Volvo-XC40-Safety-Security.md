What’s the difference between safety and security?

Safety stands for accident avoidance, and security for crime prevention. The best way to explain it is to use an example: If you think of an emergency exit, on the one hand you have the safety aspect. In safety terms you need to be able to get out of the building at any time, and the door should preferably always be open. 

As far as security – with a focus on building protection – is concerned, this door would ideally not be there at all, so that no-one can get in. The goals and values of safety and security are in some places contradictory, which is what makes the subject so intriguing. In the field of classic safety, functions are enabled in potentially dangerous machinery to protect people and the environment. When it comes to security, however, you’re no longer protecting people from machines – in fact it’s quite the reverse: You have to protect the machine to ensure that people can’t bring it to a juddering halt or switch off relevant safety functions.
