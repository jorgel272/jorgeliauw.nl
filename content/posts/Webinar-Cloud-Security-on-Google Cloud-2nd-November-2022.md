On the 2nd of November 2022, we did a webinar at Xebia about Cloud Security on Google Cloud with Laurens Baardman and our fantastic host Walter van der Scheer. During this webinar event, seasoned security experts Laurens Baardman and I shared our best practices to effectively gain insight into security risks and demonstrate how Google Cloud can help you minimize these risks.

During the webinar, we discussed how Google Cloud blocked the largest Layer 7 DDoS attack at 46 million requests per second (RPS) and how you, as a Google Cloud customer, can leverage Google's DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF) capabilities Cloud Armor.

How this all began? Cyber threats and attacks as we know them today.
We discussed the history of hacking and attacks like DDoS and Ransomware.

Although cyberattacks have become more complex and frequent, you can do many things to minimize the attack surface and reduce the impact of an attack. Concepts like DevSecOps will help you transition to shift left approach, meaning that you apply security activities and continuous monitoring and guardrails in the earliest possible stage of your software development cycle.
